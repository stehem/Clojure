Looking back at those a few months/weeks down the line and after watching MIT OCW lectures on algos i realize you are supposed to
solve some of these puzzles using known algorithms such as Levenshtein distance for breathalyzer, minimax for bincrash etc...

I am not going to update for a variety of reasons, mainly because in the meantime Facebook has taken the puzzle page offline and 
even if some of the solutions are not optimal and a bit hackish i still think they are quite decent for someone who had no no prior
exposure to algorithms...
